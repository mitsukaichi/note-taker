# note-taker

## About this project

This project is done as one of the assignments of the UC Berkeley Full Stuck web developer coding bootcamp. The goal of this assigment is  to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application uses an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

The application’s front end has already been created and I built the back end, connect that with the provided frontend, and then deploy the entire application to Heroku.

The application needs to meet the following criteria: 

- notes page shows existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
- user can enter a new note title and the note’s text and a "Save Note" button and a "Clear Form" button appear in the navigation at the top of the page
- upon click of the SAVE button, the entered note appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes and the buttons in the navigation disappear
- when user click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column, that note appears in the right-hand column and a "New Note" button appears in the navigation
- when user click on the "New Note" button in the navigation at the top of the page, it shows empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column and the button disappears
